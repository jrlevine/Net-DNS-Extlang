Net-DNS-Extlang

This module implements the DNS extension language described in this draft:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-levine-dnsextlang/

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

USE WITH Net::DNS

While Net::DNS::Extlang can load rrtype descriptions from either a
text file or the DNS, it is designed to be invoked automatically by
Net::DNS to handle unknown rrtypes.  

The dnsextlang draft proposes that rrtype data is stored in the DNS at
{rrname,rrtype}.arpa.  Until the IETF approves this and puts the domain
at that location, Net::DNS::Extlang ships with a default domain suffix
(services.net.).  For the time being, the author has put rrtype data
at {rrname,rrtype}.services.net.

The domain suffix used automatically by Net::DNS can be specified using
the following global assignment:

    use Net::DNS;
    $Net::DNS::Parameters::DNSEXTLANG = 'arbitrary.example.';

Assigning undef will cause automatic package generation to be suppressed.

Once you've done that, the intention is that new rrtypes installed
on the fly work just like the ones built into Net::DNS.  The first
time Net::DNS sees an unknown RRtype, it creates implementation code
to handle the type.
